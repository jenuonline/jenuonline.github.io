                <p>
                    Holy Qurbana is the central liturgical service of the Indian Orthodox Church. It is a celebration of the Last Supper, where the members of the church come together to participate in the re-enactment of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The service consists of prayers, hymns, and the reading of biblical passages. The Holy Qurbana is conducted by a priest who offers the bread and wine as the body and blood of Jesus Christ to the faithful, who partake in the sacrament of the Eucharist. The service is a significant part of the spiritual life of the Indian Orthodox Church and is an expression of their belief in the Holy Trinity and the redemptive work of Jesus Christ.
