These services are marked by special liturgies, processions, and other rituals that highlight the significance of these events in the church calendar. Some of the major feasts celebrated by the church include Christmas, Epiphany Great Lent, Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, Easter, and Pentecost.</p>
                <p>St. Paul's Orthodox Church also provides various sacraments to its members.

The church places great importance on the sacraments and provides them to members in a way that is faithful to the teachings of the Bible and the traditions of the church.</p>
                <p>In addition to spiritual services, the Indian Orthodox Church is also committed to social and charitable activities and places a strong emphasis on education and offers various educational programs and institutions to foster religious education and spiritual growth among its members. </p>
