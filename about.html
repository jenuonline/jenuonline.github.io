                        <p>
                            The Holy Qurbana is the central liturgical service of St. Pauls Orthodox Church. It is a commemoration of the Last Supper, where members of the church come together to participate in the re-enactment of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection. The service comprises of prayers, hymns, and readings from the Bible. The Holy Qurbana is conducted by a priest who offers bread and wine as the body and blood of Jesus Christ to the faithful, who partake in the sacrament of the Eucharist. The service is a significant part of the spiritual life of the Indian Orthodox Church, and it expresses their belief in the Holy Trinity and the redemptive work of Jesus Christ.

                        <h2>Our Sacraments.</h2>
                        <p>
                            St. Pauls Orthodox Church recognizes seven sacraments that are believed to convey the grace of God to the faithful. The seven sacraments are Baptism, Chrismation, Holy Eucharist, Confession, Holy Unction, Holy Orders, and Holy Matrimony. Baptism and Chrismation, which are usually performed together, mark the initiation of a person into the church and the bestowal of the Holy Spirit. Holy Eucharist is the partaking of the body and blood of Jesus Christ, while Confession is the sacrament of repentance and forgiveness of sins. Holy Unction is the anointing of the sick with holy oil for physical and spiritual healing, and Holy Orders is the sacrament of ordination for those called to serve as clergy. Finally, Holy Matrimony is the sacrament of marriage. These seven sacraments are central to the spiritual life of the Indian Orthodox Church and are believed to bring the faithful closer to God.
